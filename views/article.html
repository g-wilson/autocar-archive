		<p>Design first and briefly, then: the A45 AMG is a fairly subtle uplift to the regular A-class Mercedes. It’s not that it lacks overt sporting cues; there are the big wheels and deep skirts and the like. It’s just that, even on its cooking models, Mercedes has given the A-class a certain visual sportiness.
		However, no other A-class has the technological armoury that this one does. There’s a truly impressive 2.0-litre engine, which gains the signature of the technician who assembled it under AMG’s ‘one man, one engine’ mantra. The specific power output of 178bhp per litre is a number to be marvelled at, even though it uses a turbocharger (see ‘Under the Skin’, p65).</p>
	
		<p>Its 355bhp goes to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and a 4Matic four-wheel drive system. It is normally front-wheel drive, apportioning power – up to a maximum of 50 per cent – to the rear wheels only once the fronts begin to lose traction.</p>
		
		<p>At the front, the A45 retains the A-class’s MacPherson strut suspension but is fitted with stiffer steering knuckles and changes to bushings, springs and dampers. At the rear, the multi-link suspension is more heavily revised – including becoming rigidly attached to the body to provide greater precision and stiffness, presumably at the expense of some refinement and isolation.</p>
		
		<p>
		Braking is by ventilated and cross-drilled disc brakes all round. There’s no ceramic option but, for £330, you can have the calipers in red.</p>

  		<h2>Interior</h2>

	<section class="contain">
	  	<p>Not every hatchback’s innards are suited to the standard ‘hot’ makeover. Fortunately for the A45, the A-class – primed to overthrow the Audi A3 – had ‘sporty’ stamped firmly on it during gestation. The belly-scrapping driving position, form-fitting seats and fist-filling steering wheel were all features of the more modest A200 CDI that we drove last year. So AMG’s fettling feels like a progressive tweak rather than a frantic attempt to turn the interior dial to 11.</p>
	  	
	  	<p>Which isn’t to suggest that every new facet contributes equally to the A45’s appeal. Too much carbonfibre-effect trim and ruby-ringed air vents leave the normally conservative dashboard looking apologetically red-faced but, where it counts – in where you sit and what you hold – it’s mostly spot on. The most noticeable addition over the standard A-class is also the most welcome: as with most other AMGs, the gear selector migrates from its naff steering column stalk to an embossed hunk of hardware located, more naturally, beneath the fall of your left hand. The ‘performance’ seats are slightly more contoured (and all the better for it) as well as being coated in grippy Dinamica microfibre, which ensured decent adhesion to road-tester-issue dark blue denim. As standard, the A45 gets a flat-bottomed, three-spoke helm to hold, but for £570 (the only optional extra inside our test car aside from the sat-nav) you can have the AMG wheel, trimmed in Alcantara and garnished with chilled-to-the-touch metal paddle shifters. </p>
	  	<p>Although secondary – in our book – to its functional duties, the cabin is obliged to live up to this car’s mighty price and the buyer expectations that inevitably come with it. Subjectively, it does this about as well as could be expected from an architecture also made to work in an entry-level model £16k distant. The usual tactile tricks (superior materials, atmospheric ambient lighting, shiny highlights and suggestive stitching) have been weaved into an already admirable level of build quality.</p>

  		<h2>Performance</h2>
    	<img src="article/photos/A45_AMG_STU_079.jpg"/>
	</section>
	
	<section class="contain">
		<p>The A45 AMG is a very fast hot hatchback. Having spent a good 150 per cent of what you might call the going rate for such a car, owners would expect nothing less. They might reasonably expect this to be the fastest car of its kind ever produced, full stop. Which is why there’s the merest possibility of dissatisfaction here – from a car that, on one key discipline, is ever so slightly guilty of under-delivering.</p>
		<p>In the past 18 months, we’ve seen two premium-brand fast hatchbacks smash the prevailing class standard on 0-60mph acceleration: the Audi RS3 (4.5sec to 60mph) and the BMW M135i (4.6sec). Relatively speaking, our clocking of the A45 – 5.2sec, set on the same piece of asphalt in similar circumstances – isn’t quite competitive. It’s also more than half a second adrift of Mercedes’ claim.</p>
		<p>It’s a problem that AMG could easily remedy – either with a proper launch control mode or a slightly longer final drive that would allow the A-class to hit 60mph in second gear. And it should. Because, underneath it all, this is undoubtedly the new performance king of the class.</p>
		<p>The A45 whistles and growls from 50mph to 100mph almost a second quicker than either the Audi or the BMW. It’s the only hot hatchback we’ve ever figured that hit 150mph inside a standing mile on MIRA’s dead-level horizontal straights. Between incredible traction, formidable mid-range torque and an unrelenting delivery at high revs, it’s nothing short of a monster and has as much performance as you could ever sanely deploy on the road.
Aside from the unexceptional pace off the line – and the occasional refusal of the paddle-shift gearbox to do what it’s told – we have only one other criticism here. Although it’s damned effective at what it does, the four-cylinder engine lacks a little bit of vibrancy, compared with the kind of performance motors available at this price. Over-dramatised gearchange pops compensate little for the fact that a BMW straight six or a Porsche boxer engine offers so much more character.</p>

	  		<h2>Ride and Handling</h2>
	    	<img src="article/photos/A45_AMG_STU_020.jpg"/>
		</section>
		
		<section class="contain">
			<p>The A45’s chassis is every inch the finely polished, hardcore marvel required to keep the car hunkered down and haulin’ in the face of all that speed and when tested by a tortured surface. The car could do with a touch more delicacy and communicative balance through a long, fast bend. But in dealing with the sort of bumps and blind corners that we Brits are likely to find on the pretty route between where we are and where we need to be, it shows off a combination of taut damping, grip, response and agility that you’ll find once in a blue moon in a hot hatchback.</p>
			<p>In places and at speeds where an M135i would begin to run out of body control and circumstances in which you’d seldom find yourself in an RS3 for simple lack of driver reward, the A45 really begins to shine. The dynamic appeal is a bit one-dimensional, in that it flows more from what punishment the chassis will take than from what it’ll give back. This is a car to hustle into the apex, hard on the brake pedal, rather than one to hurry through the heart of a corner on the power. The dampers instantly hoover up bumps with lots of commitment and under considerable lateral load.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the car feels directionally alert but not hyperactive. There’s a slight stability bias about the cornering balance. That makes it almost as quick in the wet as it is in the dry and it allows you to use as much power as you like the minute you start unwinding the steering without fear of oversteer. But it also means that the car’s attitude through a bend isn’t remotely throttle-adjustable – which is the kind of handling enrichment that you can sometimes find in a four-wheel-drive performance car.</p>
			<p>Someone high up at Affalterbach clearly thinks that this is how an 
AMG hot hatchback – a feeder car, perhaps, into something with a more mature repertoire – should handle. For us, it could do with a more rearwards torque bias. But either way, it’s a blast to drive.</p>

		</section>
		
		<section class="contain">
			<p>The bigger part of these two elements is the buying – because at £37,845 before you start getting involved with the options list, the A45 AMG demands a lot of your money even before you worry about the ownership costs. It’s two-Ford-Fiesta-STs-and-change sort of money. Or a Fiesta ST and a Caterham Seven Supersport, if you’re happy to do a bit of spannering. Our test car cost more than £50,000, which is faintly ludicrous.</p>
			<p>Inevitably, then, an estimated residual value of £18,600 after three years doesn’t look very clever, and although we returned nearly 30mpg, you have to do a lot of miles at slow motorway speeds before you’ll feel like you’ve recouped your costs over cheaper but thirstier sports hatchbacks. If this feels special enough, you can forgive it.</p>

	  		<h2>Verdict</h2>

		</section>
		
		<section class="contain">
			<p>The A45 was always going to be a curious confection. Given our experience of the A-class, a savant-style imbalance seemed possible, with a preternatural talent for speed, perhaps, but one padlocked to narrow appeal and dynamic limitation. But the A45 is far more beguiling and well rounded than that. It is the best A-class by some distance. It is also ballistically quick. Better still, the savagery is not some ghastly appendage bolted on like a body kit. Thanks to a deft and tolerant chassis, it is deployable, enjoyable and fitting for the car’s ability. 
Whether it fits the huge price that Mercedes charges is another, much thornier issue. There is class-leading power and pace here, and quite possibly the looks and quality to go with it. But this is not the best hot hatch ever made, or even the best on sale as we write. And it would have to be to convince us that spending an additional £12k over a Renault Mégane 265 Cup was advisable. Or that spending just £1850 more to get a Porsche Cayman was not the way to go. Still, if you must occupy the space between the two, the A45 is a singular way of doing so.</p>
