#Autocar+ / Autocar Archive

--------------------------------

This is a prototype for a concept product for the Autocar brand.

The project was build as part of Haymarket Media's Web Fest conference with the brief "Autocar has an archive of over 5000 Road Tests stretching back 95 years - how do maximise this asset in a digital environment".

The only dataset is BMWs from the last ~15 years, and all the data is not real, apart from the article page which is taken from Autocar magazine.

Try these example searches: "BMW", "M3", "1985" etc.
